- char - the open-source ai notepad for meetings
	- **char** is short for [character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing)) - which is basically text
	- `char` is used as a [data type in C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing)#char) - it is one _byte_ and i think **char** is helping people digest information in _bite_ sizes
	- yujong and i are engineers (some might argue i'm not one but i consider myself as one) so we like this quirky name
	- also our product is a notepad/taker which captures "words"
