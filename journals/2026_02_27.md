i have so many things to do these days. but i can’t seem to be focusing on the right things. i **gotta do some clear thinking first,** and then hopefully get back to acting fast.

i also can’t let go of this anxiety of not having any clarity of what they’re doing. being able to see the team in person, which does in most cases, help resolve this. but we’re a remote company and we need to think differently.

i also want to write up good essays with clear insights about software development and product design. i want them to be interesting to mildly technical audiences like me. fwiw, i have written down few thoughts on bookface and saw some people resonated with them.

but it takes time and effort to write a good essay (or blog/linkedin post). i also realized that a lot of the posts that i’ve been posting on linkedin were more in the seo blog ~ founder-led region.

since human-first content are becoming more and more scarce, i think people are craving for them. i think my job as a founder is to actually be intentionally inefficient when writing these articles. the more human-scent it contains, it shows that it has real insights and thoughts - a trait that’s rare to discover these days.

founders are doing everything all the time.
