i have so many things to do these days. but i can’t seem to be focusing on the right things. i **gotta do some clear thinking first,** and then hopefully get back to acting fast.

i also can’t let go of this anxiety of not having any clarity of what they’re doing. being able to see the team in person, which does in most cases, help resolve this. but we’re a remote company and we need to think differently.

i also want to write up good essays with clear insights about software development and product design. i want them to be interesting to mildly technical audiences like me. fwiw, i have written down few thoughts on bookface and saw some people resonated with them.

but it takes time and effort
