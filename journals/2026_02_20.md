- i think the workflow for task management should be:
  - philo: to dump out everything that i have on my mind and explicitly add checkboxes for things that need to be done. To keep track of everything that needs to be done throughout the day.
  - aipm: to have all my tasks organized in a well structured format. Becoming the center of truth - my task HQ. it should also orchestrate tasks, so that they can be done in an orderly manner. and actually execute them by being a super-connector to tools like opencode, github, slack, notion, …
- everything i’m experimenting should be integrated into char.
- then what are the things that needs to be improved inside Char in order for these 3 products to be unified magnificently?
  - we obviously need to extract tasks, absolutely correctly, from transcripts.
  - now the transcript accuracy in terms of words being said, as well as who said what matters a lot.
  - to put it simple, That needs to understand, accent, jargons, and identify speakers.
