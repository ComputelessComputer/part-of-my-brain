- tbh won’t be able to do much work
- calculate our burn
- why do i feel like something’s off? It just doesn’t feel right. Plus, I can’t focus that much recently. what’s the most important thing for hyprnote right now? What are some not-essential stuff that I’m caught up with? need to do some clear thinking.
- we should start tracking metrics in retool or sth in the future
- right now, hyprnote is looking at user written notes that was taken during meetings and then augmenting that with the transcript and create great summaries, but in the future, if it’s just like a notepad that’s augmented with an AI. The notepad itself is basically showing traces of what the users thinking right now so for example, if I write down daily notes and have like get a PR links on it, it should kind of crawl, the content of the page and then kind of reason. Is this something that users kind of working on right now and if so, like why was it not done today it kind of act as an assistant by consistently looking at these traces and then proactively kind of suggest what should be done in order to achieve more in a more effective way.
- this is pure gold. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02YLwsCKUww](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02YLwsCKUww)
