		- our blog is a tanstack start app that was custom built to fit into the website’s tone and manner
		- we use content collections to define the schema of the content. the config file is here: https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/blob/main/apps/web/content-collections.ts
	- what we need:
		- an easy-to-use editor for non-technical users
