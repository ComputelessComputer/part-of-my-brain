- bugs that are irritating me + features needed
  - rescheduling creates dupes
    - if you click on a event in the left sidebar and start writing a note is created.
    - when you reschedule then event in your calendar app, the same event with the new date shows up, resulting in a dupe.
  - undo operations
    - if you accidentally hide an event from the left sidebar or delete a note, there is no way to retrieve it.
  - auth-related stuff
    - auth session should persist unless the user explicitly signs out from the app
    - when pro trial is over, the transcription/intelligence config should be reverted back to the state prior to starting the trial
- fck we really need to hire designteer and engineer
