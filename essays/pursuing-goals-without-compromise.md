Never compromise on what you truly want to pursue or avoid. If you’re committed, take action—don’t let anything stand in your way.

People come and go, and relationships evolve. Go with the flow, but remember that successful relationships require effort and commitment. Still, it’s never okay to lose sight of yourself. Don’t ever let that happen.
